2. Open Steam settings.

3. In "Account", select "Change..." in the "Beta participation field" and choose "Steam Beta Update".

4. Click OK on the settings windows to close them.

5. Click "Steam" at the top left of the window and select "Exit".

Steam will now close and restart with the Gamepad UI enabled!
